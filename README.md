# lein-thrush

A Leiningen plugin to thread execution.

## Usage

Put `[lein-thrush "0.1.1"]` into the `:plugins` vector of your
project.clj or user profile.

Assuming you have an `upload` task that takes a project map and a
file to upload, this will upload the jar file:

    $ lein thrush uberjar upload
